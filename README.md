# 🧠 AIDIS – AI Diagnostic Imaging System

AIDIS is a prototype system that uses artificial intelligence to **analyze and interpret diagnostic medical images**, like chest X-rays, and output predicted conditions in real time.

🎯 **Built for the STEEM Grant application**

## 💻 How It Works

- Upload an X-ray image (JPG or PNG)
- The AI model predicts possible diagnosis (e.g., Pneumonia, No Finding)
- Displays prediction + confidence level
